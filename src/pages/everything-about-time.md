Do you feel that you are very busy every day, but still don't get much work done? You may not realise it, but you actually wasted a lot of time. The intention of this article is to help you realise the time you waste unintentionally and how to better control your time.

What causes time-wasting?
Don't know the time: One of the reasons for wasting time is not understanding time. To get us started, try and answer a few questions:

Do you know how much time you have available in a day?
Do you know when you are most energetic and focused?
Do you know where all your wasted time has gone?
Can you flexibly adjust your time utilisation according to your own state?
If you can confidently answer all the questions above, congratulations, you really know your time. If you don't understand your time well enough, it will be wasted unconsciously. Let's put this into some context.

One afternoon, your manager asks you to complete an urgent task and asks you how long this will take to complete. You provide a a half-day estimation based on previous experience and promise to deliver it tonight. However, you may not realise that your work efficiency during the late afternoon and evening is much lower than in the morning. There may also be more chores that disrupt you during the afternoon which you haven't considered. When you know what time you work best and can confidently answer the four questions we raised earlier, this will increase the likelihood of completing the task on schedule.

In comparison, not knowing how you best manage your own time may lead to the inability to allocate time to the corresponding work tasks reasonably. This can make it impossible to achieve the desired results even if you spend the time you believed you could complete it in.

Prioritise trivia: In addition to the lack of understanding of time leading to low execution efficiency, another stronger time killer is prioritising trivia.

For example, you need to complete a report. But since the morning, you have been distracted by all kinds of trivial things: receiving consultation calls from customers; project managers asking you to discuss project issues; colleagues asking you for help; document printing but the computer cannot connect to the printer, etc. By the time you finish these things, it may be noon, and you haven't started writing the report. This can be considered ‘fake busy’ because you don’t prioritise things. You are just working on whatever comes up in front of you, and lack of planning for time.

This actually happens to a lot of people, and there are three reasons:

1. Simple and clear: the brain likes to do simple things;
2. Instant satisfaction: the brain likes to be rewarded immediately;
3. Unwilling to change: the brain likes to follow familiar paths.

In many cases, it is the brain that controls us, not that we use rationality to control the brain.

Too ambitious but not enough time: The last killer of time is being too ambitious. Most of the time we are too ambitious with our time, we want to learn python, want to learn yoga as well as catchup with friends on the weekend. But in reality, we often end up lying down at home and getting nothing done.

People with a high enthusiasm for life, want to try things in different ways, and at the same time, believes in the importance of quality of their work, often feel as though there isn't enough time. Many times we cannot want both quality and quantity. If we want quality, we must sacrifice some quantity and focus on it, and vice versa.

Being too ambitious can also cause anxiety over time, which will affect our efficiency.

Solutions to better manage our time.
When we understand what is causing the waste of time, we can come up with corresponding solutions.

The first step is: Effectively analyse time and make time use more efficient.

The first step is to find your 'Golden Time'. This refers to the period of time when you have the most energy and state within a day. The more scientific method is by recording the time, and finding out the time period that your efficiency and output is highest. When you have a strong awareness of yourself and when you work best, this allows you to sense your 'Golden Time' accurately.

For example, my 'Golden Time' is the morning, so I consciously extend my morning time every day. I do this by waking up an hour early or by delaying lunch by half an hour to make the morning time longer. I also usually do the most important and key tasks of the day in the morning.

Effectively analysing the time also includes finding your 'Blackhole Time'. In daily life, some little things and personal habits will eat your precious time. In your unconsciousness, time disappears quietly.

For example, you originally planned to go to the supermarket to buy a box of eggs, but after you went in, you found that there was a discount on chocolate, and your favorite ice cream brand had a new flavor. Unknowingly, you might stay in the supermarket for half an hour. This is the typical ‘Shopping Blackhole Time’.

The second step: Plan your time in a smarter way.

After you have a basic sense of time, you can start planning your time: knowing what to do at what time and making things more orderly. Here I recommend a time planning tool: time management matrix.

Section 1: Important + Urgent
Critical issues, emergencies, last-minute work.

Working on a very important project that's due the next day.

Section 2: Important + Not Urgent

Principal goals and long-term projects.

Strategising and planning for an important long-term project.

Section 3: Not Important + Urgent

Interruptions and distractions, low-value 'busy' work.

Phone calls, replying to emails, time tracking, etc.

Section 4: Not Important + Not Urgent

Time wasting and trivia.

Social media scrolling, mindless web browsing.

As you can see, there are four sections divided by importance and urgency. And everything we do in life/work can be sorted by them. We should be focusing on the top two sections because they are 'important', but we should also be trying to minimise section 1 (important and urgent) as much as possible. This section deals with unforeseen issues — unexpected yet pressing problems. If we spend enough time in section 2, we should reduce the number of urgent tasks we have to deal with.

Section 2 is all about proper planning and investing in ourselves. This means putting the necessary time (including improving skills) in before things become urgent and out of control. This is the area we should prioritise since doing as this will help us be more effective in our work and minimise feeling overwhelmed and stressed.

Section 3 is about 'wasting' time. When we say 'wasting time', it means you may spend the time, but not for yourself. For example, at work, your colleagues may always temporarily call you to help. In this way, taking all the work that is not yours into your own hands will cause your own time to be wasted. In this case, we cannot change others' behaviour, but we can change how we think of things and how should we deal with them.

If it consumes all your time, perhaps it's worth trying to balance this - by sometimes jumping in to help, and sometimes recognising that you are at capacity. The most important thing is to do your own thing steadily and concentrate on improving your skills. But if a colleague really needs help, and the matter is within the control of your own time and ability, you can also actively assist. Learn to use your own inefficient time to do it, such as arranging to do it in your own non-golden time when things are not urgent.

Section 4 is about relaxing and entertainment. This part of the time is not that important to us, but we will also need it, after all, everyone will need to relax. But what we can do to minimise the use of this time, if possible, it can be converted into Section 2 — investing time for ourselves. For instance, instead of sleeping the whole day to recover your body, doing exercise can sometimes be a better choice.

Once you've identified which tasks are truly important, you can start to create more undisturbed space for working on them. You'll notice doing this will free up time for undisturbed, and prolonged focus. We also suggest organising your schedule thoughtfully to make sure you give the most of your time to these key tasks. One way you can do this is by blocking out periods of time in your calendar to focus on the task at hand.

The last step: Making friends with the time.

Once we have understood time and can make a suitable plan for ourselves, the next step is to implement this time plan. In fact, putting this into practice is often the most difficult step. For example, you can't help but do some trivial tasks during your golden time, and you can't help but occasionally check the news headlines.

This is because our brains like instant gratification and want immediate rewards. Reading the news for a while can be satisfied immediately, but spending an hour to write a report is not immediately satisfied. Therefore, under the control of the ‘brain’, we immediately made the ‘happier’ choice. This is a mentality of instant gratification. In order to overcome it, we can use another approach - delayed gratification.

Delay in gratification: In order to pursue longer-term goals and obtain greater gains, you can restrain your desires and give up the temptation in front of you.

From another perspective, delayed gratification can be regarded as a trade-off. It is to choose the long-term value and give up short-term pleasure. If you want to do a lot of things, it can be difficult to choose, and you may find that there isn't enough time. That's because you didn't really find what you want most, so you can't judge the priority of things in your mind. There is only one criteria for judging the choice: whether it is beneficial to reaching your goal (whether it is long-term or short-term).

Hopefully you have learnt to understand time and found some helpful tips for mastering your own time. It is important to know the principles, but it is only when you practice them in your life that you can really make it work. We hope you can continue to improve your time utilisation, and truly be friends with time.
