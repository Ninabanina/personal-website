Whether in life or work, we often set ourselves various goals. For example, I would like to improve my professional skills this year or I want to lose 5 kg in 3 months. But despite our good intentions, why do so many of us struggle to achieve our goals? Perhaps we were wrong in the first step: the goals we've created don't really suit us.

Let us look back at the two goals mentioned above. You may find that the first goal is not executable because it is vague, and the second goal seems difficult to achieve because these numbers are too ambitious (it looks intimidating, at least to me).

In order to make meaningful progress towards reaching our goals, it's helpful to dismantle them:

By disassembling goals, we can break large and difficult-to-achieve goals into small goals, which reduces resistance to taking action. The sense of accomplishment we feel by reaching these smaller goals is also the driving force for continued action. This helps us take the necessary steps required to achieve our final goal.
By dismantling the goal, we can understand how far we are from the overarching goal. Breaking this down into smaller goals helps us to find the path to achieve the goal, and take countermeasures to achieve the goal.
This is why OKRs are a great tool that helps us to disassemble our goals.

What is OKR?
OKR (objectives and key results) is a set of management tools and methods for defining, tracking goals, and evaluating whether goals are completed. The framework was first proposed by Intel. It was introduced to Google by investor John Doerr within the first year Google was founded and continues to be used today. Nowadays, more and more frontier technology companies use this method for goal management.

OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. Disassembling the goal (referred to as O) into key results (referred to as KRs) allows us to be more aware of where we want to reach the goal, see the path, and what steps we must pass along the way in order to achieve this.

Going back to the goal that I set myself earlier: losing 5 kg in 3 months. After dismantling this goal using the OKR goal-setting framework, it will look more like this:

O: losing 5 kg in 3 months;

KR1: The three meals are matched with fiber, protein, and carbohydrates in proportion, and no food will be eaten after 7 pm;

KR2: Aerobic exercise is not less than 4 times a week, each time is not less than 50 minutes, the heart rate is not less than 140, and one day a week is set aside for two 50-minute intensive training;

KR3: Strength training is not less than 2 times a week, 30 minutes each time;

KR4: Adjust work and rest, avoid staying up late, go to bed before 23:30.
This example also illustrates a relationship between goals and key results. The goal of losing 5kgs in 3 months seems measurable at first glance. However, if we don't break it down, it can be overwhelming to know how to start since the goals are quite ambitious. By breaking down the goal into measurable key results, we can focus on ensuring each key result is reached and then finally, the overarching goal is achieved. In this way, whilst performing these tasks, we can clearly establish the distance between our current output and the goal we are working towards. This is convenient for adjusting and implementing countermeasures.

Hopefully, you have now developed an understanding of the key concepts and usage of OKR. Now, we're going to look at the results this goal-setting framework generates. The core purpose of OKR is to find the key results. Finding the key results means that we have designed and planned every step leading to the goal, and completed the drawing of the road map. In the next part, we will explain how to determine the key results of the goal.

Method of determining key results: What-if analysis
The 'what-if' analysis method refers to the process of, after receiving the goal, analysing the gap between the current status and the goal. This allows us to form a hypothesis of the path to achieving the goal. Then, we can verify the hypothesis which will help clarify the key results.

For example, if you are a director of the sales department, you may receive a goal: to increase sales to 50 million in this quarter. How do we find the key results?

The first step is to use a 'what-if' analysis to find the difference between the current status and the goal: After investigation, we can find that the current sales are around 30 million and there is a downward trend. In other words, the difference between the current status and the goal is 20 million.

After clarifying the difference, we have to form a hypothesis on ‘how to achieve the goal’. In this example, we need to find the reason for the difference in order to clarify the solution.

In the second step, we need to find the reason behind the poor sales results. It is often difficult, but we can use previous experience, ask experts we trust or search for information, to make basic assumptions. Later, it is recommended to discuss and verify these assumptions with relevant people. This could be a team member who worked on this before or a subject matter expert. Then we can create a list based on a sound base of information.

In this example, the reasons for the gap between the current status and the goal could be:

1. Insufficient sales channels;

2. Decrease of large customers.
   In the third step, based on the above assumptions, we can think about the key results needed to achieve the goal. For example, this could be: five new channel partners were added, achieving sales of 12 million.

What is a good key result？
We now understand how to find the key results, but in practice, we may still struggle to write good key results. Let’s take a look at the formula for writing key results.

I will (Objective) as measured by (this set of Key Results).
We can follow this formula to write the key results. An example is: I will create an awesome customer experience as measured by improving customer feedback score from X to Y.

It is worth noting that when dismantling OKR, the purpose is to find out the KRs that affect O, not to make a task or action list. How can we judge the quality of KR? Generally, good KR has the following characteristics:

Quantification: KR needs to be quantified to eliminate possible confusion. At the same time, we must be able to use objective data to confirm whether we have achieved your goals. For example, instead of 'Increase the general customer's feedback score', use 'Improving customer feedback score from X to Y'.
Focus: The second characteristic of a good key result is focus, and the number should be limited to 2-4. Managers who have years of experience using OKRs believe that, if there are only a few key results, this usually means we are not thinking deeply enough about the goal. Likewise, if there are too many key results, this might mean that we are focussing on everything, and paying attention to nothing. The right number of goals can deepen our memory, and also serves as a reminder to ourselves to review our goals.
Key: The last characteristic of a good key result is determining whether the KR is really the key? To measure it, we can ask ourselves a few questions: Is this necessary? Is this important? Does this require more attention and energy?
After we have dismantled the OKR, we should ask ourselves the question: After completing these key results, can the goal be achieved? If the answer is uncertain, we may need to rethink. On the contrary, the answer is yes, congratulations! We have successfully set the goal and now it's time to take action!

When we first started dismantling the goal, we might not be able to achieve 100% perfection. We recognise that as long as we start to think and practice setting OKRs; with the accumulation of experience, we can definitely specify a perfectly executable goal.
